You should not miss more than 4 total sessions (including lecture and lab). If you have to quarantine due to COVID or miss class for other legitimate reasons you will not be penalized.\n\n### Late Work Policy\n\nAssignments including modules and labs may be submitted late with a **10%** deduction **per day** late. In cases of personal illnesses, emergencies, or documented accommodations, assignments may be submitted late for full credit if you notify me of your situation. \n\n### Self-Guided Module exercises\n\nEach lecture will be accompanied by a *self-guided worksheet*. This module exercise is to complement in-class content and to assist you in reviewing the material. In-class module exercises are due one week from the lecture in which they are assigned. \n\n### Reading Assignments\n\nYou will read and write a reaction four to assigned research papers. Reactions should consist of three brief paragraphs of prose (not bullet points) in your own words. A detailed description structure of these reading reaction assignments will be provided.\n\nYou will read and provide discussion question responses to chapters assigned from the course text. See course schedule for details. \n\n### Labs\n\nLabs are short-to-medium size hands-on computer security assignments that are designed to reinforce lecture. This course has a formal laboratory component. You are expected to attend each lab for the entire 50 minute lab period. Some labs may require that you work in teams of two or more. Almost all labs will require more than the 50 minute alloted time to complete, so please expect to have to spend extra time on the labs.\n\nLabs are due at 11:59 pm on the night prior to the next lab (for this course, that means 11:59 pm Thursday evening), unless I explicitly provide a different deadline. Note that some labs are more extensive, so might require two weeks to complete. In that case I will explicitly inform you of this. \n \n### Class Project and Presentation\n\nYou will work on a class project of your own choice. You will work in groups of 2 for the project. You will be required to turn in both your code and a short write-up describing the design and implementation of your project, and to make a short in-class presentation about your work. \n\n## Class Communication\n\nI will use two primary forms of communication in this class: email announcements and Slack. You are responsible for remaining up to date on any information sent by email or posted to Slack. This may include clarifications to assignments, updates on grading rubrics, and changes in office hours. \n\nFor all general course information, questions, and clarifications, please use Slack. I hope that the Slack workspace can be an extension of our classroom community where we can share questions and answers for the entire class to view and learn from.\n\nIf you have personal, individual issues you'd like addressed, you should send those by email to me. However, all course related topics should be directed to Slack.\n\n\n## Course Policies\n\n### Illness policy\n\nIf you are ill and it will cause you to miss class, lab, or an assignment, you should let me know in advance, if possible. It is your responsibility to catch up with any missed material if you are able to do so. If not, then immediately on return, work out a time-frame with me on when work will be submitted. \n\n\n### Academic Integrity policy\n\nIt is very important in this course (and in life), that your work be your own. These guidelines will help you achieve that.\n\nYou must:\n\n- Do your best to solve all homework, projects, labs, and exams on your own.\n- Write the names of any students you collaborated with as a comment at the top of your file (subject to the constraints below).\n\nYou may:\n\n- Discuss general approaches to solving the homework problems with other students, but the pen-to-paper, fingers-to-keyboard work should be your own. \n- Have another student look at a specific snippet of your code (e.g., 10 lines) to help you debug a programming error.\n\nYou may not:\n\n- Copy code to or from other students or people outside of the class.\n- Have someone else write code for you.\n- Copy code from the internet, unless you specifically reference the source and can explain how it works. This should be a tiny minority of the code you submit.\n- Write code as a group and then submit identical or slightly modified versions---if you discuss general approaches to solving a problem together, you still must be writing up your own independent solution.\n\nThe [Honor Code](https://studentdevelopment.richmond.edu/student-handbook/honor/Honor-Code-January-2023.pdf) will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully.\n\n\n\n### Generative AI\n\nYou will almost certainly be using generative AI in some way for the rest of your career. You may use generative AI tools for homework, labs, and project in the following manner.\n\nYou must: \n- Understand any code that you use. We reserve the right to review your submitted code with you, and ask you to explain how it works. \n\nYou may:\n- Ask a GenAI tool a generic question for informational purposes. For example, \"Please explain the C++ syntax for reading input from a file, and give an example.\" If you use this code, please cite the source in a comment.\n\nYou may not:\n- Ask a GenAI tool to solve the assignment. For example, you should not paste the entire problem description and ask the GenAI to solve it for you.\n- No GenAI tools can be used for the exams.\n\nThis policy is subject to change as we all learn more about how GenAI works and doesnâ€™t work as part of learning college level course content.\n\n\n\n### Disability Services \n\nAny student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact [Disability Services](https://disability.richmond.edu/) (or call 804-662-5001) to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. \n\nIf you are approved for classroom and/or testing accommodation(s) please make sure to submit a Disability Accommodation Notice to me at this [link](https://disabilityportal.richmond.edu/ClockWork/user/selfregC/courses.aspx).\n\n\n## Wellness\n\nIf any issue arises that may limit your ability to participate in class, for example, personal illness, family emergency, etc., please be sure to discuss these matters with me as soon as possible and accommodations will be made available to you as appropriate.\n\nFeelings of being overwhelmed are unfortunately quite common in the university environment. You are not alone, and there are a number of resources available to provide support in those moments. Learning to ask for help is an important part of the university experience, and if you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings of anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.
